# Skill/Attribute Challenges

Challenges are represented by rolling dice either over, or under a given threshold for multiple attributes (elements).
This gives the GM a lot of flexibility around how skill challenges occur. For any particular skill challenge,
the GM picks 3 attributes (attributes may be repeated). The player must then roll a die, and get under the threshold
for each attribute. The threshold is the 2x number of gems in the spheres matching the element in question, +1 for each gem
of the same element. The die rolled
depends on the number of gems owned of the matching element. Thresholds can be adjusted by the GM to demonstrate difficulty.

Dice for gems

| Number of Gems | Die |
| -------------- | --- |
| 0*             | d10 |
| 1              | d8  |
| 2              | d6  |
| 3+**           | d4  |
* Note that with the current rule set, 0 gems of a colour is not possible. However, there may be reason to add it as a result
of an in game effect, so it is added here
** The rules currently do not allow more than 3 gems. If this becomes a possiblity for some reason, and a player has more than
3 gems of a colour, they still only roll a d4.

Threshold Modifiers

| Level | Modifier |
| ----- | -------- |
| Trivial   | +3   |
| Very Easy | +2   |
| Easy      | +1   |
| Average   |  0   |
| Hard      | -1   |
| Very Hard | -2   |
| Nigh Impossible | -3 |

Note that the threshold can never be below 1. If characters shouldn't be able to do something, just say so, and don't bother
with a test. It is reasonable to say, for example, "You have no experience with this; you try for a while, but fail to accomplish
anything".

For example:
Robert wants to ask a villager for help. The GM asks how he wants to do so. Robert says that he wants to plea, pulling on the
villagers heart strings. The GM doesn't see any physical impact from the action, and determines the Robert is trying to actively
change the villagers mind, so he calls for an easy 'lww' (Lightning, Water, Water) test, as lightning represents change,
a water the 'aggressive interal' actions. Robert's character currently has the following grid:
L: f(1), e(1)
F: f(1)
E: l(1), s(1), w(1)
W: w(1)
S: Nothing.

So his threshold tests are (L:5(2 not lightning gems, +1 for easy) on d8, W:4(1 water gem, +1 for easy) on d6,
W:4(1 water gem, +1 for easy) on d6).

Inverse Attributes (Possible addition):

It is also possible to ask for an 'inverse' test. The player must roll 'over' a certain
attribute, rather than under. This would usually take the place of something like lying, or resisting some impulse. For example,
a player trying to appear calm before a hated enemy may be asked to roll a very easy (iF, E, S) check, i.e.: Inverse Fire, Earth
and Spirit. In this case, Earth and Spirit checks are carried out as normal, but for the 'inverse Fire check', the player must
roll **above** the number of gems in their fire sphere (using the same calculation as above). This represents a that a character
tends to find it harder to act in converse to how their elements are organised. The threshold modifiers are reversed for this test;
easier modifiers subtract, instead of add, and harder modifiers add instead of subtract.

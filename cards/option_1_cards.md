There are 4 'class' of card (based on the categories in class.md)
- Flow cards permit movement of gems between the spheres
- State cards provide actions or benefits that exist so long as gems are in the appropriate pools, and are discarded when that state ends
- Action cards provide a certain action that may or may not rely or/change the state of the gems.
- Equipment cards are played outside of the deck game and provide static effects to the characters (including possible actions or changes to how the cards/state work)

Each card should be associated with a cost, and players should not have decks with a cost that exceeds some cap based on their level (which means a larger deck of weaker cards, or a smaller deck of stronger ones). There might also be some individual card cost cap, to prevent cards from high levels being used.

Also note that there is a heirarchy of how chaining can be done (to prevent looping):

Flow -> Flow, State or Action
State -> Action
Action -> Action

### Quick Glossary:
**Chain:** After resolving this card, the player can immediately play another card of this type. If more than one card can be chained, all chains on this card must be resolved before the next set.
**Forces:** Whether a sphere is internal or external. The fire and earth spheres are internal, the water and spirit spheres are internal. Lightning is treated as both.
**Gem:** The resources used in spheres. Moved by flow cards, required by state cards and spent by action cards.
**Maintain:** Card is only in effect as long as there is at least that many gems in the pool.
**Spend:** Move a gem to the lightning sphere. This gem cannot be used in chains again until the end of the player's turn.
**Sphere:** One of the 5 spheres. A 'sphere' can refer to any sphere unless identified (e.g. fire, lightning) 
**Polarity:** Moving spheres between forces. 'Change' polarity means move a gem from an internal sphere to an external one or vice versa. 'Preserve' polarity means moving within between two internal spheres or external spheres.

## Card Class: **Flow**
Flow cards are themed around regulating inner balance. Their names reflect the mental state of the user. I expect there to not be many variations of flow cards, but for more powerful variants to appear at later levels if additional gems are awarded.

| Channel Strength | Inner balance | Deep Breath | React | Change Stance | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Move 1 gem to an adjacent pool | Move up to 2 gems to any adjacent empty pools | Move 2 adjacent gems to the fire pool | Move 1 gem in lightning pool | Spend water to move 2 gems to adjacent pools | 
| Chain 1 action | Chain 1 state | No chain | Chain 1 flow | Chain 1 action | 

| Change mind | Steel Mind |
| --- | --- |
| Change polarity of 2 gems | Spend 1 lightning to move 2 gems to the earth pool |
| Chain 1 stance | No chain |

## Card Class: **State**
State actions indicate how the inner balance of a player affects their physical presence. Players in a given 'state' should reflect this in their actions while roleplaying as well as in the benefits the card provides (e.g. a fighter in an enraged stance may be aggressive and short-tempered.)

| Aggressive | Defensive | Dash | Harmony | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Maintain 2 fire to add 1D6 to each physical attack | Maintain 2 earth to subtract 1D6 from all damage suffered | Maintain 3 lightning to double movement speed | Maintain equal forces to gain 1 extra attack each turn |
| Chain 1 action | No chain | Chain 1 action | No chain |

## Card Class: **Action**
These will be the most numerous cards, and the most class specific (ranging from actions like stealing, special attacks, orders and spells).


## Card Class: **Equipment**

### How do I practice?

When writing these cards, I envisioned players having 5 gems, and at the start of a 'combat' having each gem on one of the 5 spheres.

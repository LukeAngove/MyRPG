# Card System:

Players have the following type of cards:
- Equipment cards: These are selected before play and are placed face-up in the play area. These can include actions that are always available, or apply modifiers to other actions or board state
- Action cards: These are kept in a deck that is drawn from during the game.

Any action the player wishes to perform is dictated by cards, with a few exceptions:
	- Moving (which can be done once per turn at any time, distance dicatetd by number of gems in the yellow pool)
	- Drawing cards (done at the end of each turn, number dictated by the number of gems in the blue pool)
	- Free actions like talking or manual tasks, which can always be performed
	- Redraw, swapping cards in hand for new ones (not sure how this works yet)

## Option 1: **All** actions are cards

In this model, players have one 'action' per turn. However, many cards will permit the limited 'chaining' of actions, where followup actions can be performed after the effect of the card is played. Limitations on what kinds of card can be chained effects the strategy of play. In this mode, all characters rely on a deck that permits moving gems or actions that their actions require.
	
#### Pros:
- One set of rules for all characters
- Strength of a character is reliant on deck, so less fiddling with 'how many actions a turn'
- Strong emphasis on cards makes deck-building more strategic

#### Cons:
- Much more variety in cards means less flexible deck strategy
- A bad draw is really crippling for a character
- Lots of card chaining can be messy and confusing

## Option 2: Pool Actions and Significant Actions

In this model, players have two kinds of actions- 'pool actions' allow the movement of gems between the pools, giving a certain amount of pool actions per turn. Significant actions are performed by playing cards, which can chain as above- but chaining is a far smaller part of play than it would be in Option 1. This allows certain classes to 'neglect' the card aspect in closer focus of the pool actions, although certain cards may make pool actions more effective.

#### Pros:
- Distinct set of actions and minimal chaining makes actions easier to follow
- Permits players to neglect card game in favour of the board game

#### Cons:
- How many pool actions? How many significant actions? This makes balance harder, especially as the game scales
- Adding variety in the pool actions is trickier too- too many in deck leads to the worst aspect of both worlds.

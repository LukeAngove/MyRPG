# Mechanics

## Motion
A motion is decribed by one or more of:
- Move some number of gems into some sphere
- Have some number of gems in a sphere
- Move some number of gems out of some sphere

Note that motions in and out CAN be chained; if one action requires moving gems out of a sphere, and they move out into another sphere, and another action requires move the same gems into that same sphere, then the actions can count the same motion for both criteria.

Motions in and out CANNOT be counted twice; if two actions require the same movement (e.g.: both require moving a red gem out of the yellow sphere), then both actions need to be taken independantly.

These are represented by:

# Skill/Attribute Challenges
You may have a maximum of 5 gems in a sphere.

## Challenge Rules
Challenges are handled by rolling three dice, associated with three elements. There is one major element, and two minor.
A success requires rolling greater than a threshold on the major element, and a least one of the minor elements. A failure
on only one of the minor elements results in a minor negative side effect, the details of which are left up to the GM,
but where possible associated with the element that failed.

A challenge occurs whenever the GM asks a player to roll for a challenge. The GM will say something like 'roll a fire, water,
earth test, threshold 8'. This means that the player must roll a die for each of the elements, trying to get 6 or more for
each element. The die may be different for each element, and is determined by the total number of gems of the given element
that the player owns. The player then rolls the 3 dice, and adds a value to each die, depending on the number of gems
in the sphere matching the given element. Add 1 for every non-matching, and 2 for every matching gem. This happens for
each element independantly. A success is achieved if, and only if, the major element passes, and at least one of the
minor elements passes.

Dice for gems

| Number of Gems Owned | Die |
| -------------------- | --- |
| 0*                   | d6  |
| 1                    | d8  |
| 2                    | d10 |
| 3+**                 | d12 |
* Note that with the current rule set, 0 gems of a colour is not possible. However, there may be reason to add it as a result
of an in game effect, so it is added here
** The rules currently do not allow more than 3 gems. If this becomes a possiblity for some reason, and a player has more than
3 gems of a colour, they still only roll a d4.

For example:
Robert wants to ask a villager for help. The GM asks how he wants to do so. Robert says that he wants to plea, pulling on the
villagers heart strings. The GM doesn't see any physical impact from the action, and determines the Robert is trying to actively
change the villagers mind, so he calls for a 'Water, Lightning, Water, threshold 8' test, as lightning represents change,
a water the 'aggressive interal' actions. Robert's character currently has the following grid:
L: f(1), e(1)
F: f(1)
E: l(1), s(1), w(1)
W: w(1)
S: Nothing.

The GM has decided that the Major element is Water, and the Minor elements are Water and Lightning.

Robert has 2 water gems, so from the table above, we can see he should roll a d10 for the Major test, and again for the Minor.
He has 1 lightning gem so for the lightning test, he rolls only a d8.

Robert rolls 6 for his Major water test, 7 for his Minor water test, and 4 for his lightning test.
Robert now looks at the gems in his spheres. For water, he has only a single water gem, so he adds 2 to each of his
water rolls, resulting in 8 for his Major, and 9 for his Minor.
For lightning, he has 2 gems, but neither are lightning gems (fire and earth), so he adds 2 to his lightning test, 1 for each
of the 2 gems, giving a result of 6.

With this result, Major 8, and Minors of 9 and 6, he compares against the threshold of 8.
His Major equals the threshold, and one of his minors exceeds it, so the test passes, and the villager is pursuaded.
However, the lightning Minor failed, so the GM may decide that there is a side effect, associated with change, that
was not desired. In this case, the GM decides that the Villager sees Robert's characters point, and does as requested,
but feels that he might be being manipulated, and the GM may increase the threshold for Robert to change the Villagers
mind again in future.

Thresholds

| Level           | Threshold | 50% pass    | >=75% pass  | >=90% pass  | 100% pass  |
| --------------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Trivial         |  3        | None        | d8          | d10, 1n     | 2n         |
| Easy            |  5        | d8          | d8, 1m      | d10, 1m, 1n | 5n         |
| Average         |  7        | d8, 1m      | d8, 1m, 2n  | d10, 2m, 2n | 2m, 2n     |
| Challenging     |  9        | d8, 1m, 2n  | d10, 2m     | d12, 3m, 1n | 3m, 2n     |
| Hard            | 11        | d10, 2m, 1n | d12, 3m, 1n | None        | None       |
| Very Hard       | 13        | d12, 3m     | None        | None        | None       |
| Nigh Impossible | 15        | d12, 3m, 2n | None        | None        | None       |

Remember, if the test has a 50% pass rate from the table above, the chance of success if the Major and Minor elements
are all 50% likely to pass, then the total pass rate is 37.5%, without minor side effect is 12.5%. If they are all 75%,
then the total pass rate is ~70%, without minor side effect is 42%. If they are all 90%, then the total pass rate is ~90%,
without minor side effect is 70%. Minor side effects are common, and optional. They should not happen all the time,
and should only be used to add to the story, not be major impediments to players when unwarrented. In the common case,
it should just signify the the character had to put in significant effort; the check was difficult for them.

Also note that characters can get 100% pass rate for at least one element on an easy or trivial test, if they can predict
it happening, and moving their gems accordingly.

# Character Creation

## Starting Statistics
All characters start with 1 gem of each element.

## Calculating Secondary Statistics
**HP:** 3 for each earth gem, 2 for each fire, 1 for all others.

**Physical Defense:** Sum of lightning and earth gems, +1 for each gem in the lightning sphere, at the time of attack.

**Mental Defense:** Sum of lightning and spirit gems, +1 for each gem in the lightning sphere, at the time of attack.

**Maximum Cards Drawn:** Number of gems in the water sphere at the start of a turn. Up to this number can be drawn, cards that don't fit in your hand are discarded when handsize is checked. Cards are always drawn at the start of a players turn, players can choose to stop drawing cards early (even at zero cards).

**Hand Size:** 2 + Sum gems in spirit and earth spheres. Checked at the end of the players turn, and immediately after drawing cards. Excess cards are discarded. This does mean that you can discard cards quickly by setting a small hand size,
and having a large draw size.

**Maximum Cards Played:** 1 + the number of gems in the water sphere at the time of playing the card. If a player has 3 gems in water, then plays a card that moves 2 gems out, the player cannot play any more cards, as their limit is 1, and one card has already been played. 

**Gem movement:** 2 + number of gems in the lightning sphere at the start of a turn.

**Maximum Movement:** Number of gems in the fire sphere when the movement occurs (if movement so far this turn exceeds the current gems, the character cannot move).

# Cards

## Card Costs
 - 2x number of gems in the cost
 - +5 for static cards
 - +2 for sustained cards
 - -2 for bought cards

Cards my belong to multiple categories above. When this occurs, add all costs. For example, a sustained, bought card has a net cost modifier of 0.

## Buying Cards
Cards can only be bought with the GMs permission. It's entirely possible that specific card combinations can have greater power than initially intended. It is up to each table and GM to decide what is a good fit for their table.

Cards should be bought to some narrative effect. Players should not decide to buy new cards, and come in for the next session, having them in their deck. Players should approach the GM at some stage, and tell them that they are wanting to buy a card/cards. This can be done well ahead of being able to buy the card. The GM then has to opportunity to tell the player if they won't allow the card, and weave in ways to allow the player character to aquire the ability.

Some ways characters may aquire abilities:
- Training
- Treasure
- Quest rewards
- Recovered amnesia

These may take time during sessions, or 'down time' out of play. It is strongly recomended that aquiring new abilities be tied in with the current narrative of the game. This game targets relatively short, infrequents sessions, with constant character growth. If each ability takes a whole session to earn, then the narative may never progress. Aquiring abilites should not be trivial, but if there is a long story associated with it, just describe the narrative of it. There should not be too much rolling involved, after all, if you plan to give a player the ability regardless, what are they rolling for?

## First Play
When players first aquire an ability, it's new, fancy, and dramatic. Most players will want nothing more than to find the perfect place/time to play it. This is a good thing, and adds to the narrative. To make this more common, whenever a player aquires a new ability, they can keep it to the side, and just play it as if it were in their hand, as an extra card. Once it has been used once, it is the same as any other card. This helps create dramatic scenes, as you would find in a book or film, and adds to players feeling like their new ability is powerful and useful.

This mechanic is not intended to let players build up a set of cards that they can play whenever they want. If this becomes a problem, and the GM feels like this mechanic is being abused, it can be removed, or altered, such that the game becomes fun, and challenging.

## Playing Cards
Steps:
1. Declare all cards that are being played simultaneously
2. Check that all cards may be played (e.g.: check that there are more gems in the water sphere than cards played this turn)
2. Pay all costs of cards (any gem should only move one sphere at most in this phase).
3. Resolve all tests and outcomes of cards using this new state of the board.

## Owned Cards
Players may buy as many cards for characters as they want. They do not need to use them all, however.

Players can choose which cards they own are in thier active deck. If they wish to change their deck, it takes 10 minutes of in game time.

## Decks
These cards a placed face down in the play area, and are where players draw cards from. When the deck is empty, players shuffle thier discard pile, and use it as their new deck. If both are empty, the player simply cannot draw any new cards.

When a deck is empty, a player must stop drawing cards for that turn, regardless of any abilities or gems in the water sphere.

## Drawing Cards
Maintaining and casting magic takes concentration and effort. Characters do not generally walk around thinking about what magics are available at each moment. As such, players generally do not keep their hand available. However, they may draw a hand whenever they like, if they have no current hand. This represents the character suddenly focusing on magic.

Cards are drawn at each turn in combat, or any situation outside combat that the player wants to (keeping within the guideline of 6 seconds). Generally, out of combat, players will not have cards drawn. At the end of every scene, if players have cards drawn, the GM should declare the scene ended, and all cards should be discarded, and all discards shuffelled back into the deck.

## Bought Cards
Cards of this type cannot cannot be placed in a deck. Instead, they are bought during a scene. At the start of a new scene, all cards that have been bought are removed from the player's hand, deck and play area. The player's deck is then reshuffelled.

### Buying during play
Cards that are 'bought' are always placed face up in the play area. They are bought by paying their casting cost. Sustained cards need to pay their sustain cost, but only at the instant they are bought. They are immediately placed in the discard pile.

## Scenes
A 'Scene' is a period of time in game. It is ultimately determined by the GM, though a single combat is always a single scene. As a rule of thumb, a scene ends, and a new on begins at any point you imagine the words 'time passes' could be said. It indicates that a major change in the scenario has occured, or the characters mindset has changed.

An example would be when combat ends, and the characters spend some time looting bodies. Actions to search the room after this would be in a new scene.

A counter example would be that a combat ends, but before players can start looting corpses, another combat begins (an ambush, for example). This is NOT a new scene; the adrenaline from the previous combat has not yet subsided, and characters will still be in the same mindset as they were in the initial combat.

When in doubt if it is a single scene or not, the GM makes the final call (as always).

## Playing cards
A turn is approximately 6 seconds of in world time. In combat, cards are played in turns. In other periods of play, it is less defined when new cards can be drawn. This is ultimately up to the GM, but 6 seconds is a good rule of thumb.

### Conversation
In conversation, players can draw cards about every 6 seconds. This takes concentration. If the player wants to stall for time, in order to draw a particular card, then either the player can role play stalling, and can draw cards every ~6 seconds, with a nod from the GM, carrying on the converstation.

If not, the GM can instead ask for a skill check to stall for 6 seconds. If using this method, the GM chooses what the test is, though it should be relevant, and the player should have input into how they are stalling, the same as any other test. In most cases, the longer a character needs to stall for, the harder the test should be. The difficulty of the test should also represent how much the player's character needs to input into the situation; if listening to an NPC monologue, a test may not even be required. If the character is giving a speech, then it would likely start as an average test, and increase the threshold by 2 for each subsequent test.

### Out of immediate action
If a character has no immediate impetus to do anything within a restricted time frame, they can just declare that they are taking some time to do the action, pick up their whole deck into their hand, arrange their cards into play, shuffle their deck, and draw a new hand. This takes 10 minutes, or less if the GM agrees. If less, the time frame should be declared before the player commits, and rearranges their cards. This represents the fact that given enough time, the player could essentially just cycle through their deck multiple times, and just get the arrangement that they wanted.

This rule in combination with the taking 10 minutes to change a character's deck means that if a character has 20 minutes, they can rearrange all of their cards into the deck, and in play set up that they desire. The deck must still be shuffled, and cannot be ordered by the player, and their hand should be randomly selected by drawing from the shuffled deck. This is an intended feature of the game, and gives players and advantage for taking the time to analyse their situation, and prepare for it in the best manner possible.

## Card Notations
### Ranges
Ranges are not given a unit of measure, just a number. This is because many RPG systems use different units that different tables prefer. From a rules perspect, it doesn't matter. If a unit is necessary, use 'meters', but feet, yards, or some made up unit all work just as well as each other, and your table can choose whatever fits.

### Percieve
Some actions are more obvious than others. Ultimately, how dificult an action is to notice is up to the GM. However,
to assist players and GMs get on the same page. To do this, cards may be notated with one of four options for the
'Percieve' attribute:

| Value    | Meaning                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hidden   | Must be looking for it to see. Suggest a test if the user is being actively watched.               |
| Subtle   | Can be noticed, but is unlikely. Suggest a simple test if not actively watched, harder if watched. |
| Obvious* | Will be noticed if watched, possibly hidden if obscured somehow, but is in general spotted.        |
| Awesome  | Will definitely be noticed; will draw a crowd, and draw attention.                                 |

\* If a card does not have a 'Percieve' attribute, then it is obvious.

Where a card has both an active effect and a sustain effect, 'Percieve' refers to the active effect. It is up to the GM and players to determine how obvious the sustain effect is. As a rule of thumb, use one level lower, however ultimately this decision is left with the GM.

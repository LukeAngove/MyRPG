# Goals
## Pillars
 - Create a strong roleplaying experience
 - Simple mechanics
 - Complex strategy
 - All players should be able to be engaged as much as possible
 - Multiple characters should work together
 - Only roll for important things
 - Minimise cruft and noise in gameplay (e.g.: weight, inventory management)
 - Characters should be good at what they are good at, and bad at bad; random spikes should be rare and dramatic

## Secondary Goals
### Combat
 - Turns should be short
 - Turns should be impactful and dramatic
 - Turns should be able to be planned for ahead of time as much as possible; minimal changing numbers inside a turn.
 - Player characters should be able to work together for tactical advantage

### Social
 - All players should be able to be engaged
 - Players should not be required to always engage
 - Good roleplaying should help interactions
 - Players who cannot roleplay a section should still be able to engage

### Skill challenges
 - No trivial tests; trivial actions should not require a roll
 - Players and player characters should be able to help each other, where it makes sense
 - Group tests should exist
    - Group tests should not pass or fail based on a single players' roll

# Forces
2 Sides:
 - Black: external forces
 - White: internal forces

# Spheres
5 Spheres:
 - Lightning (yellow): dexterity, quick thought, change
 - Fire (red): strength, aggression, force of will on others
 - Water (blue): intelligence, outlandish thinking, innovation
 - Earth (brown): constitution, health, balance, intimidation
 - Spirit (green): mental strength, memory, will power

All forces are connected to lighting (change). Lightning is both internal and external.

# The Flow
The movement of elements between each other; moving of counters between the spheres.

The Major Flows are the connections between Lightning and the other elements. These represent the links of different
elements to change.

The Minor Flows are the connections between Earth and Water, and Spirit and Fire.

Characters start with 1 gem of each color.
Characters can move gems along flows as an action.

# Mechanics
- Number of gems in a sphere (possibly of a particular colour)
- Number of gems moved in/out of a sphere, or along a particular flow or type (Major/Minor) flows.
- Number of gems in either Inner or Outer Forces. 
- Balance of gems in Inner and Outer Forces. 
- Balance of gems in opposing elements (non-connected Spheres)
- Balance of gems moved between Spheres or Forces.

# Magic/Abilities
Cards can be used for magic and abilities. Possible status of cards:
- Static
    - Tapped
    - Untapped
- Played
    - Tapped
    - Untapped
- In hand
- In deck
- Discarded
- Available (think face up but not in deck, like a deck builder)

Doing actions with cards should require some interaction with the board.

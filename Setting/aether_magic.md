# The Aether
The aether is rather poorely understood. It is somewhere along the lines of another realm that overlaps with the material plane. What is known is that it supports the existance of spirits. These spirits can be used and manipulated by some, giving them great powers.

Spirits are controlled by manipulating the aether. Those with sufficient training, and ability, can manipulate the elements that connect the material world (lightning, fire, earth, water and spirit) to the aether.

Spirits are poorly understood, and take many forms. Some appear to be concious, but the majority do not. They manifest in many ways. Some associate themselves with objects, from legendary weapons, to mundane items, like a bucket. Others manifest through actions of material beings.

Spirits tend not to cluster, generally being solitary beings. However, powerful forces of mental strength can draw more spirits to a single location. Spirits are also frequently found gathering around moving bodies of water; beaches and rivers.

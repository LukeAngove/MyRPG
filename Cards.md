#Cards

### Card Costs
 - 2x number of gems in the cost
 - +5 for static cards
 - +2 for sustained cards
 - -2 for bought cards

Cards my belong to multiple categories above. When this occurs, add all costs. For example, a sustained, bought card has a net cost modifier of 0.

## Playing Cards
Steps:
1. Declare all cards that are being played simultaneously
2. Check that all cards may be played (e.g.: check that there are more gems in the water sphere than cards played this turn)
2. Pay all costs of cards (any gem should only move one sphere at most in this phase).
3. Resolve all tests and outcomes of cards using this new state of the board.

## Owned Cards
Players may buy as many cards for characters as they want. They do not need to use them all, however.

Players can choose which cards they own are in thier active deck. If they wish to change their deck, it takes 10 minutes of in game time.

## Decks
These cards a placed face down in the play area, and are where players draw cards from. When the deck is empty, players shuffle thier discard pile, and use it as their new deck. If both are empty, the player simply cannot draw any new cards.

When a deck is empty, a player must stop drawing cards for that turn, regardless of any abilities or gems in the water sphere.

## Drawing Cards
Cards are drawn at each turn in combat, or any situation outside combat that the player wants to (keeping within the guideline of 6 seconds). Generally, out of combat, players will not have cards drawn. At the end of every scene, if players have cards drawn, the GM should declare the scene ended, and all cards should be discarded, and all discards shuffelled back into the deck.

## Bought Cards
Cards of this type cannot cannot be placed in a deck. Instead, they are bought during a scene. At the start of a new scene, all cards that have been bought are removed from the player's hand, deck and play area. The player's deck is then reshuffelled.

### Buying during play
Cards that are 'bought' are always placed face up in the play area. They are bought by paying their casting cost. Sustained cards need to pay their sustain cost, but only at the instant they are bought. They are immediately placed in the discard pile.

## Scenes
A 'Scene' is a period of time in game. It is ultimately determined by the GM, though a single combat is always a single scene. As a rule of thumb, a scene ends, and a new on begins at any point you imagine the words 'time passes' could be said. It indicates that a major change in the scenario has occured, or the characters mindset has changed.

An example would be when combat ends, and the characters spend some time looting bodies. Actions to search the room after this would be in a new scene.

A counter example would be that a combat ends, but before players can start looting corpses, another combat begins (an ambush, for example). This is NOT a new scene; the adrenaline from the previous combat has not yet subsided, and characters will still be in the same mindset as they were in the initial combat.

When in doubt if it is a single scene or not, the GM makes the final call (as always).

## Playing cards
A turn is approximately 6 seconds of in world time. In combat, cards are played in turns. In other periods of play, it is less defined when new cards can be drawn. This is ultimately up to the GM, but 6 seconds is a good rule of thumb.

### Conversation
In conversation, players can draw cards about every 6 seconds. This takes concentration. If the player wants to stall for time, in order to draw a particular card, then either the player can role play stalling, and can draw cards every ~6 seconds, with a nod from the GM, carrying on the converstation.

If not, the GM can instead ask for a skill check to stall for 6 seconds. If using this method, the GM chooses what the test is, though it should be relevant, and the player should have input into how they are stalling, the same as any other test. In most cases, the longer a character needs to stall for, the harder the test should be. The difficulty of the test should also represent how much the player's character needs to input into the situation; if listening to an NPC monologue, a test may not even be required. If the character is giving a speech, then it would likely start as an average test, and increase the threshold by 2 for each subsequent test.

### Out of immediate action
If a character has no immediate impetus to do anything within a restricted time frame, they can just declare that they are taking some time to do the action, pick up their whole deck into their hand, arrange their cards into play, shuffle their deck, and draw a new hand. This takes 10 minutes, or less if the GM agrees. If less, the time frame should be declared before the player commits, and rearranges their cards. This represents the fact that given enough time, the player could essentially just cycle through their deck multiple times, and just get the arrangement that they wanted.

This rule in combination with the taking 10 minutes to change a character's deck means that if a character has 20 minutes, they can rearrange all of their cards into the deck, and in play set up that they desire. The deck must still be shuffled, and cannot be ordered by the player, and their hand should be randomly selected by drawing from the shuffled deck. This is an intended feature of the game, and gives players and advantage for taking the time to analyse their situation, and prepare for it in the best manner possible.
